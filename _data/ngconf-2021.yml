    name: "Shmuela"
    surname: "Jacobs"
    company: "ngGirls Founder"
    title: "Web Developer and Consultant, Founder"
    description: "In July 2014 I've been chosen to participate in Django Girls Berlin, as part of Europe's PyConf. I had just finished my M.Sc. and was thinking about the future. Although I've had programming experience, this event inspired me to explore the world of development, and especially Web development, even deeper, and join the Tech industry. Today I am ready to give back. So not with Django, but with Angular, which I really love."
    bio: "Shmuela Jacobs is a front-end developer and consultant mastering Angular. During her academic studies (M.Sc. in Information Management Engineering and B.Sc. in Physics) she has combined her passions of coding and teaching as a software developer, teaching assistant, science museum guide, and researcher. Today she continues to enjoy these activities as a full-time developer, sharing her knowledge and experience in meetups and conferences around the world."

    bio: "<p>The last years I’ve learned how great diversity can be. I was in some conferences with big diversity support
          (like jsunconf and craft conf). I met a lot of clever female developer and speaker from which know-how I was
          impressed and learned. And I think there are a lot more outside and a lot more who have the talent.
          So it is important to support them.</p>
          <p>As Shmuela asked for that, I decided within in 30s that it would be an honor to do that.</p>
          <p>There are several projects with an impressive diversity support and very good material.<p>
          <p>And last but not least I’m still reading the book of Software craftsmanship by Sandro Mancuso
          in which he shows how important and good it can be to give something back to the community and how important
          it is to learn from other developers. And I think I could also learn as a mentor from the participants.</p>

    Hello! I am Cassandra. You can call me 'Casey'! I've been in the industry for quite some time now and I'm really shy but I want to go out of my comfort zone to do something meaningful. I'm interested on how I can make a difference in the developer community especially helping bridge the gender gap. I once gave a lecture on a Girls Who Code event and I would like to continue doing that if given a chance. I get so inspired and fulfilled whenever I see more girls can code. You have no idea how excited I get every time I see female developers!
