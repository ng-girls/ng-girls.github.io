  <p>Of course! There are several ways you can help: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Mentors</b> - you have a significant impact on the participants' experience.
      If you can volunteer your time, knowledge, and positive encouragement during the workshop and provide some support on the days before and after, we'd love to have you!
      You don't need to be an Angular expert - web developers are welcome.
      Click on <b>Call for Mentors</b> on the event page,
      or <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWw5cOjjGNM7cxUpk7F7fYBZU4_1okOH9sYlwU-WcY6U8Sjg/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">
      subscribe to our newsletter</a> to get notified about our future events.
      <br/>
      <p style="margin-top: 5px; font-style: italic;">During online workshops, mentors are asked to outreach to their attendees more often to create extra
        communication touch points and encourage attendees to post screenshots, images, and messages on their progress so everyone can celebrate their successes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Sponsors</b> - with your help we can make our events truly awesome! From funding tickets to Angular conferences,
      through supplying lunch, to providing swag - there's lots of opportunities to help.
      <!--ngGirls has <b>sponsorship collaboration with <a href="http://angular-up.com/" target="_blank">AngularUP</a> - </b>
      you can receive a <b>Bronze or a Diversity plan</b> at AngularUP by supporting ngGirls!-->
